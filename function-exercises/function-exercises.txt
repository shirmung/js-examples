The Puppy Age Calculator

You know how old your dog is in human years, but what about dog years? Calculate it!

Write a function named calculateDogAge that takes 1 argument, your puppy's age, and calculates your dog's age based on the conversion rate of 1 human year to 7 dog years, returning the result to the screen like so: "Your doggie is NN years old in dog years!".
Call that function three times for a few different ages.

Bonus: Add an additional argument to the function that takes the conversion rate of human to dog years.
